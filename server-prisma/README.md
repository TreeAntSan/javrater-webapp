## dotenv

There is a secret file that is not in this repo. .env
(located at `./server-prisma/.env`)

This file has a few things that need to be kept secret and a few things that aren't really that secret:
```
PRISMA_STAGE="dev"
PRISMA_ENDPOINT="http://localhost:4466/server-prisma/dev"
PRISMA_CLUSTER="local"
PRISMA_SECRET="SOME_SECRET_KEY"
APP_SECRET="ANOTHER_SECRET_KEY"
```

The first three lines pertain to simple Prisma server settings. You start the Prisma server by using the command `prisma deploy` if you're installed the prisma module globally, otherwise `yarn prisma deploy`/`npm run prisma deploy` should work. Also, if you run into issues `prisma local stop` and `prisma local stop` tend to help.

The next two variables are secret keys that you should set to random strings of characters and digits and symbols. I used two random [`UUID4`](https://www.uuidgenerator.net/)s for mine.

`PRISMA_SECRET` is the secret key for the Prisma server (a local Docker container). If you change this secret you'll need to re-deploy the Prisma server. From there you can use `prisma token` to grab a new token if needed. This token is used when using the Playground when you add to the HTTP header like this:
```
{
  "Authorization" : "Bearer <token>"
}
```

`APP_SECRET` is used by the login system for the server. It is used as the secret key to the [`JWT token`](https://jwt.io/) signing process in `src/utils.js`. If you change this secret all users will have to log in again.

You *need to create this file* before things can run. You can even copy the example I have above if you want.

This file is used by the module [`dotenv`](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv)

## Features

- **Scalable GraphQL server:** The server uses [`graphql-yoga`](https://github.com/prisma/graphql-yoga) which is based on Apollo Server & Express
- **GraphQL database:** Includes GraphQL database binding to [Prisma](https://www.prismagraphql.com) (running on MySQL)
- **Authentication**: Signup and login workflows are ready to use for your users
- **Tooling**: Out-of-the-box support for [GraphQL Playground](https://github.com/prisma/graphql-playground) & [query performance tracing](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-tracing)
- **Extensible**: Simple and flexible [data model](./database/datamodel.graphql) – easy to adjust and extend
- **No configuration overhead**: Preconfigured [`graphql-config`](https://github.com/prisma/graphql-config) setup
- **Realtime updates**: Support for GraphQL subscriptions (_coming soon_)

You can more learn about the idea behind GraphQL boilerplates [here](https://blog.graph.cool/graphql-boilerplates-graphql-create-how-to-setup-a-graphql-project-6428be2f3a5).

## Requirements

You need to have the [GraphQL CLI](https://github.com/graphql-cli/graphql-cli) installed to bootstrap your GraphQL server using `graphql create`:

```sh
npm install -g graphql-cli
```

## Getting started

```sh
# 1. Bootstrap GraphQL server in directory `my-app`, based on `node-advanced` boilerplate
graphql create my-app --boilerplate node-advanced

# 2. When prompted, deploy the Prisma service to a _public cluster_

# 3. Navigate to the new project
cd my-app

# 4. Start server (runs on http://localhost:4000) and open GraphQL Playground
yarn dev
```

## Documentation

### Commands

* `yarn start` starts GraphQL server on `http://localhost:4000`
* `yarn dev` starts GraphQL server on `http://localhost:4000` _and_ opens GraphQL Playground
* `yarn playground` opens the GraphQL Playground for the `projects` from [`.graphqlconfig.yml`](./.graphqlconfig.yml)
* `yarn prisma <subcommand>` gives access to local version of Prisma CLI (e.g. `yarn prisma deploy`)

> **Note**: We recommend that you're using `yarn dev` during development as it will give you access to the GraphQL API or your server (defined by the [application schema](./src/schema.graphql)) as well as to the Prisma API directly (defined by the [Prisma database schema](./generated/prisma.graphql)). If you're starting the server with `yarn start`, you'll only be able to access the API of the application schema.
