Docker Notes
To launch everything at once go to the root of this git repo and run
  `docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d`

To launch just the client:
  `docker-compose -f client/docker-compose.yml up -d`

To launch just server-prisma:
  `docker-compose -f server-prisma/docker-compose.yml up -d`

To launch just the prisma server and DB:
  `docker-compose -f server-prisma/database/docker-compose.yml up -d`

After launching prisma server:
  `cd server-prisma; prisma deploy;`
  (you need prisma install globally, do so with `npm i -g prisma`)

To kill and remove the docker processes (this WILL delete the database)
  `docker kill $(docker ps -aq)`
  `docker rm $(docker ps -aq)`
  `docker network prune` (optional but may-as-well if nuking everything)

You may also want to delete images to clear hard drive space:
  `docker images` (look for images with empty REPOSITORY entries, they're redundant)
  `docker rmi <container1> <container2> ... -f`

Optionally of course you can kill/rm just specific docker containers.
If you want to nuke prisma and the db just kill/rm those two.

If you ever get complaints about networks or bridges existing already, run:
  `docker network prune`

Currently playground does not work and will need to be run manually.
  `cd server-prisma; graphql playground;`
  (you need graphql install globally, do so with `npm i -g graphql`)

There is a problem with playground at the moment - you'll have to edit server-prisma/database/prisma.yml and delete / comment-out the setting "endpoint" to make it work. Pretty dumb.
