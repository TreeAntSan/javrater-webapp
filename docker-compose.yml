  # 1) Change from (external) networks.prisma to networks.javrater-webapp. This network itself is defined at the top.
  # 2) build.context has been changed from . to ./server-prisma and ./client in order to make the Dockerfiles be in
  #    the correct location.
  # 3) Each service has been given a static IP address and an alias. These are not necessary for browsing as these
  #    aliases only apply to the inter-container network bridge. A browser will still access the client at port 3005,
  #    server-prisma at port 4000 and playground at port 3010. These static IPs and aliases might be useful for testing,
  #    though.

      # localdev or in a container.
      # In localdev, this server will be run locally in node, and will hit 'self', which will be an alias to
      # 127.0.0.1 (localhost).
      # In a container this file is run and the server will hit 'self', which will be an alias to 172.18.0.20
